        <h2>Purpose</h2>
          Like many other people, I've always had a passion for traveling. I was less than a year old when I took my first international flight. I was traveling to visit my extended family in Taiwan, and I haven't look back since. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to travel to numerous states across the U.S. and countries across the world. As a result, I want to use this digital platform to share my photography and written experiences with other people who also posses the hunger to explore and learn more about the world around them.

        <h2>Background</h2>
          When I'm not traveling, I am a first year Master's student at the University of Michigan School of Information studying Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on User Exerperience (UX) Design.
